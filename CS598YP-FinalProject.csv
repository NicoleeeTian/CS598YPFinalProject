* **Identifying the Relevant Result:** The question specifies a ""retired Democratic-Republican hold"" as the result. Looking through the provided texts, Pennsylvania's district appears to fit this description, indicating that William Wilson and John Murray were the incumbents.
* **First Elected Representative in 1816:** This condition confirms that Pennsylvania's district is the one being referred to because, according to the texts, the first elected representative in this district was in 1816.
* **Incumbents:** The text for Pennsylvania's district clearly lists **William Wilson** and **John Murray** as the incumbents.
